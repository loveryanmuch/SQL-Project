# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL
 E-Commerce Sales product data Analysis

## Project/Goals   
The goal of this project is to use the SQL knowledge I learned at LIGHTHOUSELABS during the two weeks to learn how to read, clean and inspect data and analyze patterns about the company's current customers and products.


## Process
### Step 1 Prepare raw data to be read from the database
1) Got some data about e-commerce sales from the Compass site.
2) Put the data into PostgreSQL database.
3) Cleaned and changed the data to make it ready for looking at.

### Step 2 Read the data using pgAdmin4.
1) Checked the data to understand things like how much stuff costs, how much people buy, and who the customers are.
2) Scan the overall data to see if there are any unusual errors.
3) Cleaning data using SQL queries to more easily identify trends and patterns.
 
### Step 3 Finding the patterns of data
1) Analyze product performance by category, SKU, city or country
2) Check sales patterns focusing on the most and least selling products
3) Use meaningful values by combining overlapping consumers
4) In e-commerce, think about categorizing customers who are likely to view the product, customers who are likely to purchase the product, or both.


## Results
-Even though there is a variety of data, the customer base that actually makes purchases and increases profits is limited.
-Certain product categories perform better than others.
-Because there is a lot of unset data, it is difficult to determine the exact factors that influence consumers when making a purchase.


## Challenges 
- Joining multiple tables and aggregating data efficiently was a challenge, especially with large datasets.
- There were many missing parts in the vast data, and complex SQL queries were required to perform analysis that was easy to see at a glance.
- It was difficult to re-examine whether the query code I had processed was correct.

## Future Goals
If more time were available, I would:
- Implement predictive analytics to forecast future sales and customer behavior.
- Enhance data visualization using external tools or libraries for more advanced visualizations.
- Find out what factors play a role in purchasing by checking patterns that are different from what I expected.
